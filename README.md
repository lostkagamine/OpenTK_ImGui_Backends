# OpenTK ImGui Backends
This is a partial reimplementation of the
[ImGui backends](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/master/backends)
for C# and [OpenTK](https://github.com/opentk).  

## Why?
I felt that integrating Dear ImGui with OpenTK was too complex,
especially for new users. This project aims to bring quick, easy integration
with Dear ImGui inside of C#.  

## How do I use this?
**Please don't reference the .NET assembly in your project.**
Just copy the file you want into your project. You can do that, it's fine.
After that, look at the header comment of the file for instructions.
